# Miguel Castro

**Creative & Research Director**  
Award-winning creative with a practice rooted in reductionist thinking, systems design, and the intersection of technology and culture. My work reimagines how we communicate, create, and connect — not by disrupting, but by revealing what’s missing and designing from the essential.

I specialize in building tools, campaigns, and digital products that are purposeful, elegant, and strategically human. Over the years, I’ve transformed leading brands, founded my own consultancy, and led projects recognized at Cannes Lions (Grand Prix in Innovation) and Effie Awards.

## Guiding Principles

- Make the invisible visible  
- Design for long-term clarity, not short-term noise  
- Use technology to expand intuition, not replace it  
- Think in systems, act with precision
